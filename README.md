## Description

Spark is a react-native application, with a mongoDB backend. We store user login data in Google Firebase.
<br>
Spark connects ideas to teams. Users can post their own 'brainstorms', and swipe left and right on other's projects. As a creator of a brainstorm, you can accept and reject applicants. When you are satisifed with the teammates you accepted, you can go ahead and start a project!
